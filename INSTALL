1 .In the composer.json file in require-dev
put "jlle/env-info" : "0.1.*"

It is important that you do not put yourself in

"requires": {

}

since it would go up to production

2. At the root of the project and at the same level as composer.json

create an empty file with the name: envinfopass

This is so that even in a development environment, the information cannot be accessed if this file does not exist.
In production should not be created

3. In the config/routes.yaml file
Introduce:

envinfo:
  path: /envinfo
  methods: GET
  controller: Jlle\EnvInfo\Controller\EnvInfoController::envInfo
